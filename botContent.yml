                  ### Climate Change
                  One of the major problems on our planet is linked to the global temperatures that are continuously rising. By 2100, [studies show](https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/climate-change/) that there is a 50% likelihood of facing global warming that is higher than 3.5 degrees Celsius and a 10% probability of witnessing warming higher than 4.7 degrees Celsius (relative to temperatures registered between 1850 and 1900). This would result in more severe shifts in weather patterns, food and resource shortages, and the more rapid spread of diseases.
                  **Possible solutions:**
                  A cut in greenhouse gas emissions and increased awareness of the necessity of turning green are among the solutions that can make a significant difference. In addition, proposing strategies to cut carbon emissions and opting for replanting are effective ways to advance climate change.

                  ### Wars and military conflicts
                  [
                   ](https://www.developmentaid.org/api/frontend/cms/file/2022/08/fundamental-purpose-for-establishing-the-United-Nations.svg)Maintaining peace and security is crucial to preventing poverty and high numbers of refugees and asylum seekers. With an increasing number of territories becoming conflict zones, the number of poor and displaced women and children is on rise, causing the spread of diseases and a halt to economic progress.
                  Preventative diplomacy and demilitarization are the two key tactics for avoiding conflicts. Preventive diplomacy is defined as those actions undertaken to avoid conflicts from forming or worsening. It can also help to limit the spread of existing hostilities. Mediation, conciliation, or negotiation are all options to tackle this world issue.
                  **Refugee statistics:**
                  - At the end of 2020, according to the [UN](https://www.unhcr.org/refugee-statistics/), the world had 82.4 million forcibly displaced people with over 25% of these being refugees
                  - Around 35 million (42%) of all displaced people were children under the age of 18
                  - The [UN Refugee agency](https://www.developmentaid.org/donors/view/118395/unhcr) data shows that in mid-2021 around 4.3 million stateless people were living in 93 countries (although it has been estimated that the true figure is much higher)
                  - 85% of all refugees are housed in developing countries

                  ### Water contamination
                  There is no life without water – apparently a simple truth but one that people seem to overlook. Poor management and irrational use forces communities to migrate in search of drinking water. Industries are polluting underground water and this issue is growing massively.
                  - Due to pollution, poverty, and inadequate resource management, around [2.1 billion people](https://www.who.int/news/item/12-07-2017-2-1-billion-people-lack-safe-drinking-water-at-home-more-than-twice-as-many-lack-safe-sanitation) lack access to safe drinking water
                  - Agriculture is responsible for 70% of global water loss
                  - Annually, 297,000 children under the age of five die from diarrheal infections caused by poor sanitation, hygiene, or contaminated drinking water
                  - 80% of wastewater is discharged into the environment without being processed or reused
                  
                  **Possible solutions to the water pollution issue:**
                  The most efficient technique to reduce water pollution is to [treat water](https://www.hunterwater.com.au/our-water/water-supply/water-quality/how-we-protect-our-water-supply/water-treatment-processes) (filtration, disinfection, etc.) before it reaches the waterway system. Clearing wastewater of pollutants can be performed via biological, physical, and chemical operations.

                  - **Human rights violation**
                  Indeed, the problems in today’s society are linked with the constant violation of human rights – gender inequality, human trafficking, the lack of freedom of speech – all of these can be witnessed in the 21st century in every country, even in developed nations.
                  **Gender Equality**
                  50% of the world’s population are women and girls. Gender equality is not only a crucial [human right](https://www.un.org/en/global-issues/gender-equality), it is also necessary for a peaceful society, the full development of human potential, and long-term evolution.
                  **Possible solutions to gender inequality:**
                  - Speak up for what you believe in
                  - Pay attention to what others have to say
                  - Defend yourself from discrimination
                  - Raise public awareness of a problem
                  - Get the media to talk about it
                  - Demonstrate to those in positions of power that they are being watched

              ## **Corruption**
              The most widely spread endemic in India is corruption, which must be handled quickly and wisely. There is hardly any office, in both the private and public sector, that is untouched from this disease. There is no telling how much loss the economy has suffered because of this. Though most of us are concerned, when the time comes to act, we, the people of India, should not be found lacking.
              ## **Illiteracy**
              The percentage of illiteracy in India is alarming. Though 74.04% of people were counted as literate in 2011 census, there is a wide disparity between rural and urban areas and male and female population. The condition in villages is worse than in cities. Though a number of primary schools have been set up in rural India, the problem persists. Many people who are counted as literate can barely read or write. Hence, providing education just to children won’t solve the problem of illiteracy, as many adults in India are also untouched by education.
              ## **The rise in Global Protectionism**
              India is still in its developing phase, on the way to becoming a developed nation. Our country is enthusiastically overcoming each and every challenge coming across its way. Some of the grievances listed by India against developed countries such as the US are the problems encountered by the exporters of IT services, and tariffs imposed on the exports of products like steel and aluminium by the US. The US has also imposed sanctions on the purchase of crude oil from Iran, which is likely to hamper the Indian economy and increase its import bill. Moreover, India faces a constant threat of tariffs from many countries, and pressure to open up its domestic market. Therefore, the newly formed government must take necessary steps to protect the interests of India from foreign powers, that are constantly interfering in all spheres.
              ## **Agricultural Distress**
              India is a country which is widely famous for its agriculture throughout the world. But the sad plight of our country lies in the fact that here farmers face too many problems. Such as lack of basic amenities of irrigation systems, agricultural implements and short or long-term loans. The exploitation of farmers at the hands of moneylenders is a very prominent and common issue that immediately needs to be looked into. Stories of farmers committing suicide appear in the media almost every day. As per the India economic survey 2018, the estimated data states that the percentage of agricultural workers in the total workforce is likely to drop up to 25.7% by 2050 from 58.2% in 2001. Therefore, agriculture needs to be revived at the earliest.
              ## **Unemployment**
              Unemployment, nowadays, is very common among the youth. This situation is also known as joblessness. Moreover, it is a set of circumstances where an able-bodied person is willingly searching for a job but is not able to find it. We can calculate the percentage of unemployed people prevalent in the economy by dividing it with the number of individuals currently present in the labour force. The government of India must take the necessary steps to eradicate it by creating more government and public sector job opportunities. Also, it needs to support private sector industry that could provide jobs to the ones who really deserve it. As per the Centre for monitoring Indian Economy data, the rate of unemployment has touched 8.10% in February 2022. This rate of unemployment is high for a country like India. If not tackled immediately, it will become a challenge for our society and economy**Infrastructure**
              India needs to work swiftly on its infrastructure development, towards better roads, affordable housing and services like water, sanitation, primary healthcare, etc. According to the Union budget 2021, the government has allocated Rs 233,083 crore to enhance the transport infrastructure. Adding to this, Government of India is also expanding the National Infrastructure Pipeline (NIP) and is expected to invest $1 trillion to boost the infrastructure

Adding to this, Government of India is also expanding the National Infrastructure Pipeline (NIP) and is expected to invest $1 trillion to boost the infrastructure.
              ## **Pollution**
              Pollution and environmental issues are the other challenges that India is facing at present. Though India is working hard, there is a long way to go. Degradation of land, depleting natural resources, and loss of biodiversity are the main issues of concern due to pollution. Untreated sewerage is the major cause of water pollution. The Ganga and Yamuna rivers are today two of the most polluted rivers in India. Same is the condition of other rivers that pass through populated cities. Additionally, increasing construction and vehicular traffic also contribute to pollution in the cities. India needs to embark on a model of sustainable development.
              ## **Healthcare System**
              It is true that the world’s most populous democratic country cannot provide proper healthcare facilities to its entire population. India is becoming a hub for medical tourism but all these facilities are not available to local residents, who happen to be poor. Healthcare is a neglected issue in India, as major attention drawers are agriculture, infrastructure and IT. Lack of resources in rural India is a major concern of the day, leading to most of the problems. 50% of all villagers have no access to healthcare providers; Infant Mortality Rate (IMR) is 34 per 1000 live births; lack of nutrition caused stunning growth in 50% of all the babies, and 36% people in India have no access to toilets.
              Despite the country’s medical tourism bringing in $2.8 billion in 2020 and being the fourth largest medical devices market, the healthcare system for the Indian citizen has been a disappointment. According to a report by NITI Aayog, the country has 1.3 hospitals bed per 1000 population with almost 50% of it concentrated in states like Karnataka, Telangana, Uttar Pradesh, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, and Maharashtra.

                      Today the Earth is home to more than [7.8 billion people](https://www.populationmedia.org/issues-world-population-growth/). By 2100 the population is on track to hit [10.8 billion](https://www.un.org/development/desa/en/news/population/world-population-prospects-2019.html), according to the United Nations — and that’s assuming steady fertility declines in many countries. Interestingly, if extra progress is made in women’s reproductive self-determination, and fertility falls more than the United Nations assumes is likely, the population in 2100 [might be a relatively smaller 7.3 billion.](https://population.un.org/wpp/Graphs/Probabilistic/POP/TOT/900)
                      For now, the world’s population is still increasing in huge annual increments (about 80 million per year), and our supply of vital non-renewable resources are being exhausted. Many factors contribute to these unsustainable trends, including falling mortality rates, underutilized contraception, and a lack of education for girls.
                      ### **FALLING MORTALITY RATE**
                      The primary (and perhaps most obvious) cause of population growth is an imbalance between births and deaths. The [infant mortality rate has decreased](https://www.who.int/gho/child_health/mortality/neonatal_infant_text/en/#:~:text=Situation%20and%20trends&text=Globally%2C%20the%20infant%20mortality%20rate,to%204.1%20million%20in%202017.) globally, with 4.1 million infant deaths in 2017 compared to 8.8 million in 1990, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). This is welcome public health news, of course.
                      At the same time, lifespans are increasing around the world. Those of us who are alive today will likely live much longer than most of our ancestors. Global average life expectancy has [more than doubled since 1900](https://ourworldindata.org/life-expectancy), thanks to advancements in medicine, technology, and general hygiene. Falling mortality rates are certainly nothing to complain about either, but widespread longevity does contribute to the mathematics of increasing population numbers.
                      ### **UNDERUTILIZED CONTRACEPTION**
                      The global fertility rate has fallen steadily over the years, down from an average of 5 children per woman in 1950 to 2.4 children per woman today, according to the [UN Population Division](https://population.un.org/wpp/DataQuery/). Along with that promising trend, contraceptive use has slowly but steadily [increased globally,](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/family-planning-contraception) rising from 54% in 1990 to 57.4% in 2015. Yet, on the whole, contraceptive use is still underutilized. For example, according to the WHO, an estimated [214 million women](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/family-planning-contraception) in developing countries who want to avoid pregnancy are not using modern contraceptives.
                      These women aren’t using contraceptives for a variety of reasons, including social norms or religious beliefs that discourage birth control, misconceptions about adverse side effects, and a lack of agency for women to make decisions around sex and family planning. An estimated [44% of pregnancies](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X(18)30029-9/fulltext) were unintended worldwide between 2010-2014. Getting more women the access and agency to utilize family planning methods could go a long way in flattening the population curve.
                      ### **LACK OF FEMALE EDUCATION**
                      Although female access to education has increased over the years, the gender gap remains. Roughly 130 million girls worldwide are out of school currently, and an estimated [15 million girls](https://www.populationmedia.org/wp-content/uploads/imported-files/sdg-report-gender-equality-in-the-2030-agenda-for-sustainable-development-2018-en.pdf) of primary school age will _never_  learn to read and write, compared with 10 million boys.
                      Increasing and encouraging education among women and girls can have a number of positive ripple effects, including [delayed childbearing](https://www.populationmedia.org/wp-content/uploads/imported-files/female_education_employment.pdf), healthier children, and an increase in workforce participation. Plenty of [evidence](https://www.populationmedia.org/wp-content/uploads/imported-files/female-education-and-its-impact-on-fertility.pdf) suggests a negative correlation between female education and fertility rates.
                      If increased female education can delay or decrease fertility and provide girls with opportunities beyond an early marriage, it could also help to mitigate current population trends.
                      ## **THE EFFECTS OF OVERPOPULATION**
                      It is only logical that an increase in the world’s population will cause additional strains on resources. More people means an increased demand for food, water, housing, energy, healthcare, transportation, and more. And all that consumption contributes to ecological degradation, increased conflicts, and a higher risk of large-scale disasters like pandemics.
                      ### **ECOLOGICAL DEGRADATION**
                      An increase in population will inevitably create pressures leading to more deforestation, decreased biodiversity, and spikes in pollution and emissions, which will exacerbate climate change. Ultimately, unless we take action to help minimize further population growth heading into the remainder of this century, many scientists believe the additional stress on the planet will lead to ecological disruption and collapse so severe it threatens the viability of life on Earth as we know it.
                      Each spike in the global population has a measurable impact on the planet’s health. According to estimates in a study by [Wynes and Nicholas (2017)](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/aa7541), a family having one fewer child could reduce emissions by 58.6 tonnes CO2-equivalent per year in developed countries.
                      ### **INCREASED CONFLICTS**
                      The scarcity brought about by environmental disruption and overpopulation has the potential to trigger an increase in violence and political unrest. We’re already seeing wars fought over water, land, and energy resources in the Middle East and other regions, and the turmoil is likely to increase as the global population grows even larger.
                      ### **HIGHER RISK OF DISASTERS AND PANDEMICS**
                      Many of the recent novel pathogens that have devastated humans around the world, including COVID-19, Zika virus, Ebola, and West Nile virus, originated in animals or insects before passing to humans. Part of the reason the world is entering “[a period of increased outbreak activity](https://www.populationmedia.org/wp-content/uploads/imported-files/WEF20HGHI_Outbreak_Readiness_Business_Impact.pdf)” is because humans are destroying wildlife habitats and coming into contact with wild animals on a more regular basis. Now that we’re in the midst of a pandemic, it has become clear how difficult it is to social distance in a world occupied by nearly 8 billion people.

              ### **Water Pollution**
              This type of pollution refers to the contamination of bodies of water including [groundwater](https://www.alphaenvironmental.com.au/services/groundwater/). As all living organisms depend on water to live, the pollution of a body of water tends to affect every level of the ecosystem, including human health. Common causes of water pollution include industrial waste, insecticides, pesticides, and fertilisers, detergents and oil spills. These pollutants either work by killing off organisms through their toxicity (industrial waste, insecticides), or reducing oxygen values in the water (known as Eutrophication) by blocking out sunlight (detergents, oil).
              ### **Air Pollution**
              Air is usually comprised of 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen, 0.9% oxide gases and 0.1% inert gases. When the air becomes contaminated with other elements such as poisonous gases or particles, it can cause serious problems to human health. The most common causes of air pollution include partially combusted exhaust gases, poisonous gases which are a by-product of industry including sulphur dioxide and carbon monoxide, and carcinogenic gases released through the burning of plastic, rubber and wood. Particle contamination can also occur when a substance such as friable asbestos fibres are disturbed and released into the air. Air pollution works either by poisoning living organisms which breathe it in, or by disturbing the atmosphere and mixing with their air and clouds to cause acid rain. In the case of particle contamination, particles such as asbestos fibres become airborne and are inhaled, irritating the respiratory system and causing health conditions.
              ### **Soil Pollution**
              Soil can be stripped of it’s nutrients (and therefore fertility) by a number of chemical agents and when this occurs, it is known as soil pollution. Common causes of soil pollution include pesticides, insecticides, agricultural chemicals, industrial waste, and radioactive waste. Plants depend on the nutrients in the soil in order to grow, but many of these chemical compounds absorb the nitrogenous compounds present in the soil which the plants depend on. Aside from making an area barren, soil pollution is a common cause of erosion, as plants and other living organisms play an important role in keeping the soil held together. When they die off, the soil splits and begins to erode. The heavy metals which get into the soil via chemical pollution also have a devastating effect on the ecosystem as they alter the metabolism of microorganisms and arthropods living in the soil. These heavy metals become more concentrated as they move up the food chain, often wiping out predator or consumer species at the apex.
              ### **Thermal Pollution**
              Many industries release heat energy as a by-product and once released into the environment, this thermal energy is partially responsible for global warming. Manufacturing industries release thermal energy into the air as well as into bodies of water. This in itself is not necessarily a bad thing although it can dramatically alter local ecosystems. The problem arises from the excess of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere. Carbon dioxide prevents heat from exiting the atmosphere, so the heat from the sun, combined with the excess thermal energy which is a by-product of many industries as well as vehicles cannot escape and raises the temperature of the atmosphere. Global warming is responsible for the melting of the polar ice caps which in turn have led to a rise in sea levels.
              ### **Radioactive Pollution**
              When radioactive metals disintegrate, they release beta rays which can cause a whole host of mutative diseases in living organisms, this is known as radioactive pollution. As the name suggests, radioactive pollution mostly comes from the nuclear power industry, either in the form of radioactive waste being dumped or improperly disposed of and then making its way into bodies of water, or from the accidental release of radioactive substances when a nuclear reactor is damaged. Once radioactive pollution is present in the environment, it can linger for decades, making enormous areas of land unfit for human occupation of any sort.
              ### **Noise Pollution**
              Noise pollution refers to an excess of unpleasant sounds emanating from industry, infrastructure, heavy machinery, transportation, and even human occupation being released into the environment. In humans, noise pollution can have a detrimental effect on both mental and physical health and has been linked to high stress levels, hearing loss, hypertension, depression, sleep disturbances and an increase in incidences of coronary artery disease. Noise pollution also reduces the amount of viable habitat for wildlife as it interferes with sounds and communication, making it difficult for animals to navigate, mate and detect predators or prey
              ### **Light Pollution**
              The excessive, obtrusive, and misdirected use of light in areas of human habitation as well as in industry cause light pollution. Light pollution is defined as the alteration of natural light levels in both indoor and outdoor environments through human interference. Light pollution causes headaches, fatigue, stress and anxiety. Light pollution disrupts eco systems by confusing animal navigation, altering predator-prey relations, disrupting plant growth and pollination, and change competitor interactions.

              ## What you can do
              Be a part of the solution to pollution.
              The choices that we make every day can help to make a difference.
              Here are some simple steps you can take:
              1. Commute smart by walking or riding to work or the shops instead of driving. Motor vehicle emissions remain the most significant source of most common air pollutants.
              2. Choose a fuel-efficient vehicle next time you are replacing your car. The [Green Vehicle Guide](http://www.greenvehicleguide.gov.au/) provides ratings on the environmental performance of new vehicles sold in Australia.
              3. Save energy, by turning off the television and make sure you flick the light switch when you leave the room. Not only will you save money on your electricity bill, you will be reducing emissions from coal-fired electricity plants.
              4. Buy energy -efficient appliances. Check the energy rating label when buying new or second hand electrical appliances. More stars mean less emissions. The [Energy Rating web site](http://www.energyrating.gov.au/) will help you select energy efficient appliances.
              5. Use environmentally friendly cleaning products. Phosporus in detergents increases nutrient loads in rivers and can cause excessive algal growth. Never pour chemicals or fertilisers down the drain as they get washed into stormwater drains and into rivers or the ocean.
              
                 **What industry is doing**
              Industry can use NPI data to improve manufacturing processes, and can benchmark their emissions against similar facilities. Annual reporting also assists industry in documenting progress in reducing emissions and provides a measure of current environmental performance.
              
              One of the main goals of the NPI is to encourage facilities to use cleaner production techniques to reduce substance emissions and decrease waste. Reporting facilities have the option of reporting on cleaner production activities and pollution control developments that they have undertaken during the reporting year.
              
              The Carter Harvey Holt particle board mill in Tumut, New South Wales has implemented several emission reduction activities resulting in decreased emissions and better management of waste.
              
              In the NPI summary report of sixth year data 2003-04, the Toyota vehicle manufacturing facility in Altona Victoria is provided as a success story for innovative solutions introduced to help reduce substance emissions.
              
              ## What government is doing
              Governments can use NPI data to assist with environmental planning and management. NPI data is often used in the preparation of State of the Environment reports, and to support initiatives which help protect the environment.
              
              Pollution control is the responsibility of state and territory environment agencies.

              #### Ubiquitous Computing
              Today computers are a critical part of our lives. We have them as PCs, on our wrists, in our pockets, in cars, and even in household appliances such as TVs and fridges. Interestingly, as computers’ processing power increases, their microchips’ sizes continue to shrink. Now, we’re witnessing computers and computing devices becoming lighter, smaller, more powerful, cheaper, and more [ubiquitous](https://www.techtarget.com/iotagenda/definition/pervasive-computing-ubiquitous-computing). The average cheap smartphone today is more powerful than a 10-year-old supercomputer. These powerful computers and devices are the gateway to, facilitators of all other technology trends.
              #### Internet of Things (IoT)
              After computers, enter connected, smart, and Internet of everything. We’ve become accustomed to [IoT](https://bernardmarr.com/what-is-the-internet-of-things-iot-and-how-will-it-change-our-world/) from devices like:
              - Computers
              - Smartwatches
              - TVs
              - Cameras
              - Thermostats
              - Electronic health devices
              
              The internet of things (IoT) means an increasing number of connected, intelligent objects, devices, and ideas that can gather and transmit data. As we’ve seen the Metaverse emerge, our homes, workspaces, factories, cities, and hotels may be virtual and connected. All these spaces around us will be equipped with IoT-connected monitors.
              #### Big Data and Analytics
              The rush for careers in data science and analytics is happening for a reason. Institutions are now offering data courses like [masters in applied statistics online](https://onlinedegrees.mtu.edu/programs/ms-applied-statistics) because it’s in demand.
              Big data and analytics is considered the future of everything from Ubiquitous computing, IoT, AI, and cloud computing to blockchain. Humans also increasingly generate data masses through daily activities. Together, machines and humans generate volumes of data being generated and analyzed daily. It’s called the “datafication of the connected world.”
              Businesses use these volumes of data to improve their offerings, design better products and services, enhance their decision-making, and improve business processes. To achieve this, businesses need professionals, experts, and researchers in [data science](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/5-reasons-why-you-should-pursue-a-career-in-data-science/) and analytics.
              #### Artificial Intelligence (AI)
              Artificial intelligence is perhaps considered the mother of all intellectual technology elements. All the data being generated and analyzed is an enabler for AI. Technology in IoT, data, and computing have together helped AI make incredible leaps, particularly in “conversational AI” that affects our environment, lives, work, and play.
              AI has made more strides in navigation apps, smart personal assistants, image and speech recognition, ride-sharing apps, and much more. Many businesses are combining [AI capabilities](https://analyticsinsight.net/Student-and-AI-The-Future-of-India's-Education-Sector/#page=1) with computers, IoT, data, and computers to generate better human interaction, healthcare provision, brand visibility, and more.
              #### Robotics
              Robots are increasing and radically changing how we live and work. They reduce human risks at work and time spent working. This way, robots automate repetitive tasks, allow workers to perform other needy tasks, or replace human workers in dangerous working environments. [Robotics](https://www.roboticsbusinessreview.com/news/5-industries-that-robotics-have-disrupted-drastically/) is now used in many industries like:
              - Retail
              - Agriculture
              - Mining
              - Manufacturing
              - Warehousing
              - Healthcare
              
              While it’s feared that robotics can disrupt work and threaten the livelihood of many workers, it’s creating new job opportunities and altering existing ones.
              #### Blockchain
              Everything in the future seems to be connected and converging towards something, as we can see in blockchain. Although blockchain technology became vibrant recently, and most people think of it in relation to cryptocurrencies, it includes NFTs and the Metaverse. It is enabled by [data analytics](https://analyticsinsight.net/The-10-Most-Impactful-Data-and-Analytics-Service-Providers-of-2022/#page=1), IoT, AI, computing, and more.
              [Blockchain](https://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_Building-Blockchains.pdf) is simply data “you can only add to and not change or take away from,” thus the word “chain.” The inability to change or remove previous blocks from the chain is what makes it more secure. Additionally, blockchain is decentralized and consensus-driven, meaning that entities can control the data. This eliminates the power of third parties to oversee, control, or validate transactions.
              Future transactions might not involve physical cash, and future goods and services might not be physical. It’s an industry that’s developing rapidly and changing things as we know it.
              #### Edge Computing Over Cloud Computing
              Formerly cloud computing was the trend to watch. But it’s since become mainstream, with major players Microsoft Azure, AWS (Amazon Web Services), and Google Cloud Platform. While the adoption of cloud computing is still ongoing, a technology is emerging called [Edge computing](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/what-is-edge-computing).
              With big data to process and the realization of the shortcomings of cloud computing, such as data security, latency, and availability, organizations are opting for Edge computing. It is promising to solve these problems and get data to the organization’s data centers for processing.
              Edge computing (distributed computing framework) brings enterprise applications closer to their data sources, such as local edge servers or  IoT devices. This close proximity to data at the source can deliver robust business benefits, including reduced latency, faster insights, and better bandwidth availability.
              #### Finally
              As technology continues to grow, and with the development of 5G networks, more tech trends will continue to shape our future. As humans, we need to monitor these trends and continue to upskill and reskill to stay with the trends. These tech trends also converge and feed into each other, delivering huge changes for humans, businesses, and machines.

                  ## Energy-producing roads
                  Roads could work as solar panels and produce electricity for street lights, households and even the cars driving on them.  This bold vision led Solaroad to build the first energy-generating bike path.
                  Their main technology challenge was the top layer of the road: it had to let as much sunlight in as possible while remaining strong and damage resistant. A “SolaRoad Kit” lets you build 10m² of SolaRoad, which produces enough electricity to cover the yearly electricity needs of an average household

                  ## Medical drones
                  Medical delivery drones are used to deliver vital medical supplies to patients living in difficult-to-reach parts of Rwanda. The drones, called Zips, can carry vaccines, medicines or blood to patients. Health workers simply text an order for the medical supplies they need to a central distribution center. Within minutes a Zip is loaded and launches, travelling at around 100 km/h to its destination, where the supplies are dropped with a paper parachute.

                  ## A bag that slow cooks food
                  The Wonderbag is a much-needed innovation for the billions of people that cook over an open fire.  It allows food preparation without suffering from air pollution caused by firewood, charcoal or other fuels.
                  How it works: bring food to an initial boil, place it inside the bag, and let it slow cook for up to 12 hours. It so reduces air pollution, carbon emissions and saves energy.

                          ## **Corruption**
                          The most widely spread endemic in India is corruption, which must be handled quickly and wisely. There is hardly any office, in both the private and public sector, that is untouched from this disease. There is no telling how much loss the economy has suffered because of this. Though most of us are concerned, when the time comes to act, we, the people of India, should not be found lacking.
                          ## **Illiteracy**
                          The percentage of illiteracy in India is alarming. Though 74.04% of people were counted as literate in 2011 census, there is a wide disparity between rural and urban areas and male and female population. The condition in villages is worse than in cities. Though a number of primary schools have been set up in rural India, the problem persists. Many people who are counted as literate can barely read or write. Hence, providing education just to children won’t solve the problem of illiteracy, as many adults in India are also untouched by education.
                          ## **Education System**
                          The education system of India is blamed every now and then for being too theoretical, but not practical and skill-based. Students study to score marks, not to gain knowledge. This so-called modern education system was introduced by the colonial masters to create servants who could serve but not lead, and we still have the same education system. Rabindranath Tagore had written many articles offering suggestions to change the education system of India. But still, success is as elusive as ever.
                          ## **Basic Sanitation**
                          Sanitation is yet another problem, but one of the biggest, in India. There are about 700 million people who have no access to toilets at home. Slum areas do not have toilets. People are thus forced to defecate in the open, which causes numerous diseases like diarrhea, cholera, dehydration etc. Many rural schools also have no toilets, because of which parents do not send their kids, especially girls, to school. Due attention was drawn towards this problem by Gandhiji but nothing much was done. A growing population is the biggest challenge causing these problems. For example, the sewage system in Delhi was designed to meet the needs of a population of three million people. But Delhi now has more than 14 million of population. This is not just the case of Delhi; every state and region in India is the same.
                          Though 12 million toilets claim to have been built under Swachh Bharat Abhiyan in the last five years, as per a UN report, 44% of the population continues to defecate in the open. Sanitation, solid waste management, and drainage continue to pose challenges in India.
                          However, according to Swachh Bharat Mission website a total of 100 Million toilets were built in India, and all the States, Union Territories, Gram Panchayats, and Districts declared themselves Open Defecation Free (ODF).
                          ## **Healthcare System**
                          It is true that the world’s most populous democratic country cannot provide proper healthcare facilities to its entire population. India is becoming a hub for medical tourism but all these facilities are not available to local residents, who happen to be poor. Healthcare is a neglected issue in India, as major attention drawers are agriculture, infrastructure and IT. Lack of resources in rural India is a major concern of the day, leading to most of the problems. 50% of all villagers have no access to healthcare providers; Infant Mortality Rate (IMR) is 34 per 1000 live births; lack of nutrition caused stunning growth in 50% of all the babies, and 36% people in India have no access to toilets.
                          Despite the country’s medical tourism bringing in $2.8 billion in 2020 and being the fourth largest medical devices market, the healthcare system for the Indian citizen has been a disappointment. According to a report by NITI Aayog, the country has 1.3 hospitals bed per 1000 population with almost 50% of it concentrated in states like Karnataka, Telangana, Uttar Pradesh, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, and Maharashtra
                          ## **Poverty**
                          The population of India living below the poverty line declined from 37% in 2004-2005 to 22% in 2011-12 (Planning Commission data). In 2011-12, 22% of the population (one in five Indians) lived in extreme poverty. This figure is expected to decline to 5% by 2022, as per World Poverty Clock estimate. However, 80% of the poor in India live in villages. Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, Orissa, and Chhattisgarh have the poorest areas. 43% of the poor belong to Scheduled Caste or Scheduled Tribe categories, as per World Bank statistics (2016). This disparity needs immediate attention of the government.
                          Despite the World Poverty Clock claims of decline in poverty, the pandemic has made all all such predictions go wrong according to Pew Research Center there has been a significant decline of almost 32 million in the middle class due to the Pandemic in the country. The report also brings light on how the year of the pandemic has increased the number of poor (living on $2 or less) to have doubled from 59 million to 134 million.
                          ## **Pollution**
                          Pollution and environmental issues are the other challenges that India is facing at present. Though India is working hard, there is a long way to go. Degradation of land, depleting natural resources, and loss of biodiversity are the main issues of concern due to pollution. Untreated sewerage is the major cause of water pollution. The Ganga and Yamuna rivers are today two of the most polluted rivers in India. Same is the condition of other rivers that pass through populated cities. Additionally, increasing construction and vehicular traffic also contribute to pollution in the cities. India needs to embark on a model of sustainable development.
                          According to the World Air Quality report published in 2021, Three Indian cities (Bhiwadi, Ghaziabad and New Delhi) featured in the Top most polluted cities in the World. This stat is scary enough and requires government to take quick actions and not gamble with the health of the citizens.
                          ## **Women’s Safety**
                          Both men and women enjoy equal opportunities, but as far as freedom and safety of women are concerned, India lags behind. Issues like domestic violence, rape, the portrayal of women in media, etc., must be tackled immediately.
                          ## **Infrastructure**
                          India needs to work swiftly on its infrastructure development, towards better roads, affordable housing and services like water, sanitation, primary healthcare, etc. According to the Union budget 2021, the government has allocated Rs 233,083 crore to enhance the transport infrastructure. Adding to this, Government of India is also expanding the National Infrastructure Pipeline (NIP) and is expected to invest $1 trillion to boost the infrastructure.
                          ## **Unemployment**
                          Unemployment, nowadays, is very common among the youth. This situation is also known as joblessness. Moreover, it is a set of circumstances where an able-bodied person is willingly searching for a job but is not able to find it. We can calculate the percentage of unemployed people prevalent in the economy by dividing it with the number of individuals currently present in the labour force. The government of India must take the necessary steps to eradicate it by creating more government and public sector job opportunities. Also, it needs to support private sector industry that could provide jobs to the ones who really deserve it. As per the Centre for monitoring Indian Economy data, the rate of unemployment has touched 8.10% in February 2022. This rate of unemployment is high for a country like India. If not tackled immediately, it will become a challenge for our society and economy.
                          ## **Agricultural Distress**
                          India is a country which is widely famous for its agriculture throughout the world. But the sad plight of our country lies in the fact that here farmers face too many problems. Such as lack of basic amenities of irrigation systems, agricultural implements and short or long-term loans. The exploitation of farmers at the hands of moneylenders is a very prominent and common issue that immediately needs to be looked into. Stories of farmers committing suicide appear in the media almost every day. As per the India economic survey 2018, the estimated data states that the percentage of agricultural workers in the total workforce is likely to drop up to 25.7% by 2050 from 58.2% in 2001. Therefore, agriculture needs to be revived at the earliest.
                          ## **The rise in Global Protectionism**
                          India is still in its developing phase, on the way to becoming a developed nation. Our country is enthusiastically overcoming each and every challenge coming across its way. Some of the grievances listed by India against developed countries such as the US are the problems encountered by the exporters of IT services, and tariffs imposed on the exports of products like steel and aluminium by the US. The US has also imposed sanctions on the purchase of crude oil from Iran, which is likely to hamper the Indian economy and increase its import bill. Moreover, India faces a constant threat of tariffs from many countries, and pressure to open up its domestic market. Therefore, the newly formed government must take necessary steps to protect the interests of India from foreign powers, that are constantly interfering in all spheres.

              - **Pollution checking App**
              
              This first one is an app that was developed by three students of Bharti Vidyapeeth College of Engineering in Delhi, Tanmay Srivastava, Kanishk Jeet and Prerna Khanna. 'Air Cognizer' is an Android app that lets you measure the Air Quality Index (AQI) in your area using just your smartphone.
              Free to download, all you have to do is upload an image you've taken outdoors, half of which includes the sky region. Then, using machine learning image processing techniques and comparing it to photos and data related to the AQI, the app can tell you how polluted it is where you are. The three won a cash prize of  Rs 1,09,500 from the US-based Marconi Society for their work.
              
              - **Car Exhaust Filters From Waste**
              
              Satyam Thakur, a Class XI student from Bangalore, decided he wanted to find an easy way for people to reduce their carbon emissions. He realised that the materials that make up clay pots in many Indian households also make them good absorbers of particulate matter. He designed a cheap filter made out of broken clay pots that can be fitted over car exhausts, or even upscaled to cover the chimneys of factories.
              After use, they can be then be reformed into clay bricks for construction, or dusted off harmlessly and reused once more. Even better, he found they were also capable of filtering water to make it drinkable. And because it uses common waste, it can be incredibly cheap and easy to make.
              - **Portable Water Pollution Checker**
              
              Gitanjali Rao is just 12 years old, but she wanted to help save lives. She developed a device called Tethys, that can check the lead content in drinking water, potentially saving people from illness and even death. Not only is it fast and accurate, it's also easily portable. She believes this sort of device should be available all across India, where monsoon flooding often ends up contaminating drinking water sources with runoff from nearby factories and the like.

            activity: The formation of the **G20** is inseparable from the disappointment of the international community over the failure of the **G7** in finding solutions to the problems of the global economy at that time. The view that emerged at the time was the importance of middle-income countries and those with systemic economic influence to be included in the negotiations in order to find solutions to **global economic problems.**

                      ## **#1. Poverty**
                      In fall 2022, the World Bank [will update](https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/factsheet/2022/05/02/fact-sheet-an-adjustment-to-global-poverty-lines) the International Poverty Line from $1.90 to $2.15. This means anyone living on less than $2.15 is in “extreme poverty.” Why the change? Increases in the costs of food, clothing, and shelter between 2011-2017 make the “real value of $2.15 in 2017 prices equal to $1.90 in 2011 prices. As for the World Bank’s goal to reduce extreme poverty to 3% or less by 2030, the pandemic has made it even harder. Extreme poverty isn’t the only [poverty](https://www.humanrightscareers.com/issues/essays-about-poverty/) we have to contend with. [62% of the global population](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2022/01/history-of-global-poverty-reduction/) lives on less than $10/day. While there’s been progress over the years, the [end of poverty](https://www.humanrightscareers.com/issues/organizations-dedicated-to-fight-poverty/) is still far off.

                      ## **#2. Climate change**
                      The IPCC released its [sixth report](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg2/) in 2022. In its summary for policy-makers, the report’s authors outlined a series of near-term, mid-term, and long-term risks. If global warming reaches 1.5°C in the near term (2021-2040), it would cause “unavoidable increases in multiple climate hazards,” as well as “multiple risks to ecosystems and humans.” In the long term, climate change will present major health issues, premature deaths, risks to cities and [settlements](https://www.humanrightscareers.com/issues/who-is-a-climate-refugee/), and other dangers. Mitigation is desperately needed – and fast. Because of [climate change](https://www.humanrightscareers.com/magazine/world-bank-courses-on-sustainability-climate-action-and-development/)’s connection to other issues on this list, it’s one of the most serious challenges facing humanity.

                      ## **#3. Food insecurity**
                      According to the [2022 Global Report on Food Crises](https://www.wfp.org/publications/global-report-food-crises-2022), which is produced by the Global Network against Food Crises, the number of people in crisis or worse is the highest it’s been in the six years since the report has existed. Close to 193 million people were experiencing acute food insecurity in 2021, which is an increase of almost 40 million since 2020. This represents a staggering 80% increase since 2016. [Causes](https://reliefweb.int/report/world/global-report-food-crises-2022) include “economic shocks,” like an increase in global food prices. Domestic food price inflation in low-income countries also rose a lot. “Weather-related disasters” are also a big driver. For 15.7 million people in 15 countries, it was the primary driver of acute food insecurity.

                      ## **#4. Refugee rights**
                      According to UNHCR, the war in Ukraine sparked the fastest-growing refugee crisis since WWII. Almost [6 million](https://data2.unhcr.org/en/situations/ukraine/location?secret=unhcrrestricted) (as of May 10, 2022) people have fled. The [UNCHR’s Refugee Brief](https://www.unhcr.org/refugeebrief/the-refugee-brief-11-march-2022/), which compiles the week’s biggest refugee stories, has recently described situations in places like Somalia, where thousands of people were displaced due to severe drought. Between January and mid-April, more than 36,000 refugees from Nigeria, Mali, and Burkina Faso arrived in Niger. These are only a few examples of the refugee crises, which endangers already marginalized groups – like women and children – and puts them at an increased risk of [trafficking](https://www.humanrightscareers.com/issues/facts-human-trafficking/), violence, and death.

                      ## **#5. COVID-19**
                      The WHO declared COVID-19 a pandemic in March 2022. It will continue to be a major issue for the world. The [WEF’s Global Risks Report 2022 discusses COVID’s effects at length](https://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_The_Global_Risks_Report_2022.pdf), including major economic recovery disparities and social erosion. According to a [January 2022 article from NPR](https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2022/01/14/1072188527/for-the-36-countries-with-the-lowest-vaccination-rates-supply-isnt-the-only-issu), there are also issues with vaccinations as many countries continue to have trouble getting doses. Distribution, vaccine hesitancy, healthcare systems, and other problems also factor into low vaccination rates. While we may never know the exact impact, [the WHO estimates](https://www.who.int/news/item/05-05-2022-14.9-million-excess-deaths-were-associated-with-the-covid-19-pandemic-in-2020-and-2021) that between 1 January 2020 and 31 December 2021, there were around 14.9 million excess deaths linked to COVID-19.

                      ## **#6. Future pandemic preparation and response**
                      COVID-19 taught the world the importance of prepardeness. In a [Harvard blog](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/features/a-prescription-for-future-pandemics/), Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the WHO, outlined the lessons the world should take to heart. The first: science has to guide policy. The politicization of the pandemic led to a lot of unnecessary damage. Another lesson is that science must pair with equity or it can actually make inequalities worse. This is obvious when looking at how low-income countries struggled to get the vaccines while wealthier countries stocked up. More resilient healthcare systems are also a must, as well as more coherent, global plans on how to respond. The world must also invest in research on contagious diseases, zoonotic diseases, the effectiveness of outbreak responses, and more.

                      ## **#7. Healthcare**
                      The healthcare industry has experienced major shifts due to the COVID-19 pandemic. According to the [World Economic Forum,](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2022/01/biggest-healthcare-shifts-experts-expect-to-see-in-2022/) there’s been new investments and innovations, especially from the technology and telehealth sectors. In 2021, $44 billion was spent on health innovation. The world will be seeing the effects of these innovations for years to come, though equity will no doubt be a major issue. In places like the United States, the pandemic also reaffirmed how broken healthcare systems can be. In an [MIT News blog](https://news.mit.edu/2021/what-has-pandemic-revealed-about-us-health-care-what-needs-change-0405), Andrea Campbell, a professor of political science, says the pandemic revealed a “dire need” for investments in public-health infrastructure, as well as a need to expand healthcare access and insurance coverage.

                      ## **#8. Mental health**
                      Globally, almost 1 billion people have some form of mental disorder. The pandemic made the world’s mental health worse. According to [a scientific brief from the WHO](https://www.who.int/news/item/02-03-2022-covid-19-pandemic-triggers-25-increase-in-prevalence-of-anxiety-and-depression-worldwide), there’s been a 25% increase in anxiety and depression worldwide. Causes include social isolation, fear of sickness, grief, and financial anxieties. Health workers were also severely impacted, as well as young women and girls. The brief also highlights how the pandemic disrupted many mental health services, including services for substance abuse. Countries need to ensure access to mental health services as part of their COVID-19 recovery plans and beyond. It’s an economic decision, as well. [The Lancet ](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X(20)30432-0/fulltext)states that anxiety and depression alone cost the global economy around $1 trillion a year.

                      ## **#9. Disability rights**
                      According to [the WHO](https://www.who.int/health-topics/disability#tab=tab_1), over 1 billion people have some form of disability. Half can’t afford healthcare. They’re also more likely to live in poverty than those without a disability, have poorer health outcomes, and have less access to work and education opportunities. [Human Rights Watch](https://www.hrw.org/topic/disability-rights) lists other discriminations disabled people face, such as an increased risk of violence. There’s been progress regarding disability rights, but many countries lack strong protections. The world still has a long way to go to ensure equality for those with disabilities.

                      ## **#10. LGBTQ+ rights**
                      Members of the LGBTQ+ community face discrimination in many forms. According to [Amnesty International](https://www.amnesty.org/en/what-we-do/discrimination/lgbti-rights/), discrimination can target sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, and sex characteristics. Even in more progressive countries like the United States, people face violence and discrimination. According to the Human Rights Campaign, [more than 300 anti-LGBTQ+ bills](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/2022-anti-transgender-legislation-record-human-rights-campaign/) were proposed in 2022. At least a dozen states are considering legislation that [forbids schools ](https://www.npr.org/2022/04/10/1091543359/15-states-dont-say-gay-anti-transgender-bills)from discussing or using a curriculum that covers sexual orientation and gender identity. Considering the United States’ influence in the world, this attack on LGBTQ+ rights will likely have consequences that need to be addressed.

                      ## **#11. Reproductive justice**
                      Reproductive justice – which encompasses more than just abortion rights – is threatened by legislation, lack of funding, lack of education, and restricted healthcare access. In most places, wealth is a big determinant of whether a person can access reproductive services. It’s better in some places than others, but as we’ve seen with other issues on this list, even “progressive” countries like the United States are experiencing major shifts. In June 2022, the Supreme Court is expected to [overrule Roe v. Wade](https://www.politico.com/news/2022/05/02/supreme-court-abortion-draft-opinion-00029473), a milestone court case that protected a pregnant woman’s right to abortion. The impact would be immediate and will likely influence other countries.

                      ## **#12. Children’s rights**
                      Children are a very vulnerable group. In 2019, [around 5.2 million children under five](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/children-reducing-mortality#:~:text=Key%20facts,from%20preventable%20and%20treatable%20causes.) from mostly preventable and treatable causes. 2.4 million were newborns under 28 days old. Leading causes include preterm birth complications, pneumonia, and malaria. According to UNICEF, the [climate crisis](https://data.unicef.org/resources/childrens-climate-risk-index-report/) also represents a severe threat to kids. Around 1 billion kids live in “extremely high-risk countries” that are hit by the worst effects of climate change. 920 kids have trouble accessing clean water and 600 million are exposed to vector-borne diseases like malaria. [Child labor](https://www.unicef.org/protection/child-labour) also remains an issue. At the beginning of 2020, around 160 million were forced into labor while COVID-19 put 9 million more kids at risk. That’s almost 1 in 10 children globally. Almost half are in dangerous environments. As is often the case, the other issues on this list – climate change, poverty, COVID, gender equality, etc – factor into children’s rights.

                      ## **#13. Gender equality**
                      Global gender equality has gradually improved over the years, but data from the [2021 Global Gender Report](https://www.weforum.org/reports/global-gender-gap-report-2021) shows that the end of the global gender gap is still 135 years away. The pandemic played a huge role in reversing positive trends as women were hit harder financially. According to [Oxfam](https://www.oxfam.org/en/press-releases/covid-19-cost-women-globally-over-800-billion-lost-income-one-year), women experienced a 5% job loss while men experienced 3.9%. That means women lost about $800 million in 2020. This is a low estimate since it doesn’t count the informal economy, which includes millions of women. Women are also more likely to live in poverty, more affected by gender-based violence, and more affected by climate change.

                      The [WEF’s Global Risks Report 2022](https://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_The_Global_Risks_Report_2022.pdf) (page 9) listed cybersecurity vulnerabilities as a concern. The reason is rapid digitalization, which was triggered in part by COVID-19. Many “advanced economies” are now at a higher risk for cyberattacks. GRPS respondents identified cybersecurity failure as a critical short-term risk. In 2020, malware and ransomware attacks went up by 358% and 435%. There are a few reasons for this, including better (and easier) attack methods and poor governance. Cyberattacks have a swath of serious consequences and erode public trust. As countries become more dependent on digitalization, their cybersecurity needs to keep up.

                      ## **#15. Disinformation**
                      Rapid digitalization comes with many issues, including the lightning-fast spread of disinformation. The WEF report describes deepfakes, an accessible AI technology, and its potential to sway elections and other political outcomes. Disinformation doesn’t need to be sophisticated to be successful, however. Through social media posts and videos, [twelve anti-vax activists](https://www.counterhate.com/disinformationdozen) were responsible for almost ⅔ of all anti-vaccine content on platforms like Facebook and Twitter. Their content flooded the internet with the type of harmful, fear-mongering disinformation that played a significant role in vaccine hesitancy and political radicalization. Because disinformation [travels faster online](https://news.mit.edu/2018/study-twitter-false-news-travels-faster-true-stories-0308) than the truth, it’s a global issue that should be addressed.

                      ## **#16. Freedom of the press**
                      According to the Varieties of Democracy Institute (as reported in [The Economist](https://www.economist.com/interactive/briefing/2022/05/03/press-freedom)), about 85% of people live in a country where press freedom has gone down in the past 5 years. After peaking at .65 in the early 2000s and 2011, the global average dropped to .49 in 2021. Major countries like China, India, Russia, Brazil, and Turkey saw significant declines. Journalists and news organizations face threats like violence, imprisonment, lack of funding, and coordinated online attacks and harassment. A free press is essential to a functioning democracy. Without press freedom, all human rights are at risk.

                      In the [WEF Global Risks Report ](https://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_The_Global_Risks_Report_2022.pdf)(page 7), respondents named debt crises as one of the most pressing issues over the next decade, though respondents believe they will become most serious in just 3-5 years. COVID-19 is a big reason why. Government stimulus was necessary, but many countries are now left with debt burdens. For corporate and public finances in large economies, debt burdens can lead to defaults, bankruptcies, insolvency, and more. This is a far-reaching issue as it affects budgets for areas like healthcare and green energy.

                      Corruption encompasses a host of actions such as bribery, election manipulation, fraud, and state capture. The [World Bank Group ](https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/governance/brief/anti-corruption)names corruption as a barrier to ending extreme poverty and “boosting shared prosperity” for the poorest populations. When it comes to addressing poverty, climate change, healthcare, gender equality, and more, corruption gets in the way. Because corruption is a global problem, global solutions are necessary. Reform, better accountability systems, and open processes will all help.

                      ## **#19. Authoritarianism**
                      According to Freedom House, global democracy is eroding. That includes countries with long-established democracies. In their [2022 report,](https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/2022/global-expansion-authoritarian-rule) the organization reveals that global freedom has been declining for the past 16 years. 60 countries faced declines in the last year. Only 25 saw improvements. Only 20% of the global population lives in Free countries. China, Russia, and other authoritarian countries have gained more power in the international system, while countries with established democracies – like the United States – are losing their freedoms. What can be done? Freedom House says success “requires a bold, sustained response that establishes support for democracy and countering authoritarianism.” Governments and citizens engage and stand for democracy.

                      ## **#20. Global cooperation**
                      Addressing the issues in this article is not an easy task. True progress is only possible through global cooperation, a fact which is woven through the WEF report. Everything from addressing cybersecurity threats to [humanitarian emergencies](https://www.humanrightscareers.com/issues/why-humanitarian-aid-is-important/) to protecting democracy depends on strong cooperation between countries. As the report says in its preface: “Restoring trust and fostering cooperation within and between countries will be crucial to addressing these [challenges](https://www.humanrightscareers.com/courses/public-health-in-humanitarian-crises/) and preventing the world from drifting further apart.” The challenges threatening global cooperation are just as clear as the need, however, which makes it one of the most serious issues of the day.

                - "On 15 and 16 November 2022, the Group of Twenty (G20) held the 17th annual summit of its leaders in Bali, Indonesia. This was the first G20 summit since Russia began its war of aggression against Ukraine and the first fully fledged physical leaders' meeting since the COVID-19 pandemic began. While Russian President Vladimir Putin did not attend the summit and was represented by Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy participated by video-conference as a guest. Condemnation of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, expressed in the Leaders' Declaration, dominated the summit, taking place at a time of geopolitical tension, economic slowdown and rising food and energy prices. The final communiqué also contains a series of economic measures and political commitments relating to the global health architecture, the sustainable energy transition, and the digital transformation – the three priorities of the Indonesian G20 presidency. On the margins of the G20 summit, a series of meetings took place, notably that between United States (US) President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping, and the meeting of the leaders of the G7/NATO member countries. Another take-away of this year's summit was that the role of the emerging countries from the Global South is growing. They were decisive in overcoming differences between the major geopolitical players. The Bali Summit was the first in a row of Global South G20 presidencies. The next G20 presidencies will be held by members of the BRICS Group: India in 2023, Brazil in 2024, and then South Africa in 2025. The EU has 'strategic partnerships' with all three of them. This briefing draws on a previous one, published ahead of the 2022 G20 summit, by Angelos Delivorias."

                      #### HEALTHY CHILDREN & FAMILIES = INCREASED PROSPERITY
                      Immunisation provides a platform for delivering nutrition interventions and work hand in hand with good nutrition to help reduce child mortality. Vaccine-preventable diseases could tip children into a malnourished state as they impair the absorption of essential nutrients. Malnourished children are more likely to die from infectious diseases such as diarrhoea, measles and pneumonia, many of which can be prevented by vaccines.
                      📷
                      #### IMMUNISATION + NUTRITION = HEALTHIER FAMILIES
                      Immunisation and good nutrition go hand in hand. Vaccine-preventable diseases often tip marginally nourished children into a malnourished state. Malnourished children are more likely to die from infectious diseases such as diarrhoea, measles and pneumonia, many of which can be prevented by vaccines.
                      📷
                      #### IMMUNISATION = HEALTHY LIVES & WELL-BEING
                      Immunisation is one of the most cost-effective ways to save lives and promote good health and well-being. Every year, vaccines save 2-3 million lives, and millions more are protected from disease and disability. It routinely reaches more households than any other health service and brings communities into regular contact with the health system. This provides an effective platform to deliver other primary health care services and upon which to build universal health coverage.
                      📷
                      #### VACCINES = IMPROVED LEARNING
                      Immunisation increases educational attainment since vaccinated children learn more while they are able to go to school and perform better, positively impacting on cognitive development as well as long-term productivity. Moreover, schools are a platform for health promotion, delivery of vaccines and other health services. The benefits flow both ways: children of educated parents have a greater chance of being immunised and well-nourished and thus enjoy better health.
                      📷
                      #### IMMUNISATION = EMPOWERED WOMEN AND GIRLS
                      Immunisation is a gender-equal intervention. Globally, girls and boys are immunised at similar rates. However, there are varia- tions at sub-national levels and in some countries because a range of different barriers inhibit women’s ability to access healthcare for their children. Gavi supports countries to make focused efforts to identify and address gender-related barriers to immunisation services, such as through training female health workers, as empowering women is critical to improving child vaccination coverage.
                      📷
                      #### WASH + VACCINES = LESS DISEASE
                      Vaccines, along with clean water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH), are proven interventions to prevent diarrhoeal diseases, a leading cause of child mortality in developing countries. Investments in oral cholera and rotavirus vaccines, WASH and health systems form an integrated approach to help eliminate diarrhoeal disease.
                      📷
                      #### EFFICIENT EQUIPMENT = CLEANER ENVIRONMENT
                      Immunisation brings newer, cleaner and more sustainable technology to developing countries’ health systems. For instance, Gavi’s cold chain equipment optimisation platform gives countries access to solar and energy efficient refrigeration, which is not only more reliable and cost-effective but also more environmentally friendly. Our support includes vaccine monitoring devices that ensure optimum energy usage and reduce wastage.
                      📷
                      #### HEALTHY POPULATION = MORE PRODUCTIVE WORKFORCE
                      Investment in human capital can dramatically strengthen a country’s competitiveness. Vaccinated, healthy children grow into a productive workforce and become strong contributors to the economy. In addition, healthy children free up parents’ time so they are able to work. In Gavi-supported countries, every US$ 1 spent on immunisation generates US$ 54 in broader societal benefits of people living longer and healthier lives.
                      📷
                      #### HEALTHY VACCINE MARKET = INNOVATION
                      Gavi makes vaccine markets work better by attracting more suppliers, dramatically reducing vaccine prices and ensuring more equitable and sustainable access to vaccines and other innovative products that meet developing countries’ needs. Since our inception in 2000, we have contributed to a significant increase in new manufacturers supplying vaccines for Gavi and the majority of the vaccine doses we procure are manufactured in developing countries.
                      📷
                      #### BETTER HEALTH = INCREASED EQUALITY
                      Immunisation protects the health of communities, reduces the number of people forced into poverty, and gives children an equal chance of a healthier and more productive future. By focusing on the under-served communities and unimmunised (“zero dose”) children in the poorest and most marginalised populations, especially the urban poor and those living in remote rural settings and conflict areas, Gavi brings immunisation and primary health care services to those furthest behind.
                      📷
                      #### IMMUNISATION = HEALTHIER CITIES
                      By 2050, nearly 70% of the global population will be living in urban areas. The number of people living in slums or informal settlements has also grown to over 1 billion, many of whom lack access to basic health services. Strengthening urban immunisation programmes protects them against the increased risk of disease outbreaks and is an opportunity to bring integrated preventative services to urban and underserved communities.
                      📷
                      #### VACCINES = MITIGATION OF CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACT
                      The impact of climate change cuts across health and well-being, livelihood, and security of people, particularly for the poorest and most vulnerable communities, such as people on the move. Immunisation is critical to building people’s and systems’ resilience to and reducing the risk of outbreaks due to climate-sensitive diseases, such as yellow fever, cholera and Ebola, particularly in urban, fragile and post-disaster settings.
                      📷
                      #### STRONG HEALTH SYSTEMS = LONG-TERM STABILITY
                      Effective, safe, and people-centred health systems are the backbone of social institutions in every country, and immunisation is often the first point of contact between these systems and the population. Through Gavi support, countries’ efforts to improve equitable access to vaccines contributes to building public trust, stronger social cohesion, peaceful and inclusive societies.
                      📷
                      #### INNOVATIVE PARTNERSHIP = UNPRECEDENTED PROGRESS
                      Leveraging the comparative advantage of each partner, the Vaccine Alliance’s innovative public-private partnership model has transformed global progress by accelerating equitable and sustainable access to vaccines both at scale and pace. Since 2000, Gavi support has helped countries immunise more than 760 million children. This has helped to reduce deaths from vaccine-preventable diseases by more than 60 per cent and played a key role in halving the under-five mortality rate in those countries.

              Its origins date back to June 2003, when foreign ministers from [Brazil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil), [India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India) and [South Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa) signed a declaration known as the [Brasilia Declaration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBSA_Dialogue_Forum#Brasilia_Declaration), on June 6, 2003.In which they stated that **"major trading partners are still moved by [protectionist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protectionism) concerns in their countries’ less competitive sectors  and emphasized how important it is that the results of the current round of trade negotiations provide especially for the reversal of protectionist policies and trade-distorting practices  Furthermore, [Brazil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil), [India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India) and [South Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa) decided to articulate their initiatives of trade [liberalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalization)**".
              Nonetheless, the "official" appearance of the group occurred as a response to a text released on 13 August 2003 by the [European Communities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Communities) (EC) and the [United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States) with a common proposal on agriculture for the [Cancún](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canc%C3%BAn) Ministerial. On 20 August 2003 a document signed by twenty countries and re-issued as a Cancún Ministerial document on 4 September proposed an alternative framework to that of the EC and the US on agriculture for the Cancún Meeting. This document marked the establishment of the group. The original group of signatories of the 20 August 2003 document went through many changes, being known as such different names as the G-21 or the G-22. The title G-20 was finally chosen, in honor of the date of the group's establishment.
              Since its creation, the group had a fluctuating membership. Previous members include: **[Colombia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombia), [Costa Rica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Costa_Rica), [El Salvador](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Salvador), and [Turkey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey). In December 2017, the group had 23 members**.

                  Ukraine: War creates world’s largest displacement crisis
                  The war in [Ukraine](https://www.rescue.org/topic/ukraine-crisis) has sparked the world’s fastest, largest displacement crisis in decades, according to the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR), pushing the country into the Watchlist for the first time since 2017. Many still in the country are facing winter without access to food, water, health care, and other essential supplies. The conflict also continues to have ripple effects across the world.
                  Ukraine is not higher on the Watchlist only because the huge scale of the international response helped to mitigate the impact of the war, at least somewhat, relative to other Watchlist countries.
                  ## Afghanistan: An entire population is pushed into poverty
                  [Afghanistan](https://www.rescue.org/country/afghanistan) ranked No. 1 on the 2022 Watchlist but dropped down for 2023—not because conditions have improved but because the situation in East Africa is so severe.
                  Over a year since the shift in power, Afghans remain in economic collapse. While a rapid increase in aid prevented famine last winter, the root cause of the crisis persists. Ongoing efforts to engage the government and improve the economy have fallen short. Almost the entire population is [now living in poverty](https://www.rescue.org/article/afghanistan-entire-population-pushed-poverty) and preparing for another long winter.
                  ## Somalia: A catastrophic hunger crisis tops the Watchlist
                  Topping the Watchlist for the first time, [Somalia](https://www.rescue.org/article/crisis-somalia-catastrophic-hunger-amid-drought-and-conflict) is facing an unprecedented drought and hunger crisis. People have already lost their lives to starvation, and the country is on the brink of famine.
                  This is no “natural disaster.” Human-caused climate change has increased the frequency and severity of droughts. Decades of conflict have eroded Somalia’s ability to respond to shocks of any kind, destroying systems and infrastructure that would have provided a guardrail against the current crisis.
                  For instance, with its food production decimated by climate change and conflict, Somalia’s dependence on imports has proven disastrous—over 90% of its wheat comes from Russia and Ukraine.
                  ## Ethiopia: Drought and conflict torments tens of millions
                  [Ethiopia](https://www.rescue.org/country/ethiopia) is heading toward its sixth consecutive failed rainy season, which could prolong a drought already affecting 24 million people. At the same time, various conflicts across the country are disrupting lives and preventing humanitarian organizations from delivering aid.
                  While a November 2022 peace deal may hold and offers hope for an end to the conflict in Tigray, northern Ethiopia, 28.6 million remain in need of humanitarian aid.
                  ## Democratic Republic of Congo: Decades-long conflicts escalate
                  Over 100 armed groups fight for control in eastern [Congo](https://www.rescue.org/country/democratic-republic-congo), fueling a crisis that has lasted for decades. Citizens are often targeted. After nearly 10 years of dormancy, the M23 armed group launched a new offensive in 2022, forcing families to flee their homes and disrupting humanitarian aid.
                  Major disease outbreaks–including measles, malaria and Ebola–continue to threaten an already weak health care system, putting many lives at risk.
                  ## Syria: Years of war trigger a health crisis
                  [Over a decade of war](https://www.rescue.org/article/crisis-syria-prolonged-war-combines-natural-disaster) has destroyed [Syria](https://www.rescue.org/country/syria)’s health system and left the country on the brink of economic collapse. A decade of conflict in neighboring [Lebanon](https://www.rescue.org/node/502) has further increased food prices and poverty. Currently, 75 percent of Syrians are unable to meet their most basic needs and millions rely on humanitarian aid.

                  E-waste is any electrical or electronic equipment that’s been discarded. This includes working and broken items that are thrown in the garbage or donated to a charity reseller like Goodwill. Often, if the item goes unsold in the store, it will be thrown away. E-waste is particularly dangerous due to toxic chemicals that naturally leach from the metals inside when buried.
                  IT IS IMPORTANT TO RECYLE E-WASTE DUE TO-----
                  ### E-waste Hides Toxic Materials
                  While above ground, modern electronics are safe to use and be around. However, most electronics contain some form of toxic materials, including beryllium, cadmium, mercury, and lead, which pose serious environmental risks to our soil, water, air, and wildlife.
                  When E-waste gets buried at a landfill, it can dissolve in microscopic traces into the gross sludge that permeates at the landfill. Eventually, these traces of toxic materials pool into the ground below the landfill. This is known as leaching.
                  The more E-waste and metals at the landfill, the more of these trace toxic materials show up in the groundwater.
                  ### Leeching Poisons Nearby Water
                  The problem is that there is so, so much E-waste that the trace amounts have ballooned over the years. That toxic water under the landfill doesn’t stop below the landfill. It continues to the groundwater and the sources to all the freshwater in the surrounding area.
                  Not only is this bad for anyone using a natural well, but it hurts the nearby wildlife. That, in turn, causes the wildlife to get sick from lead, arsenic, cadmium, and other metal poisonings due to the high concentration of these minerals.
                  ### Mining For New Metals Causes This Too
                  Not only is this a problem for E-waste in landfills, but this is a side effect of mining for new sources of metal too.
                  Having an environmentally-friendly source of recycled metal is better for the environment than a company digging up new sources of ore. Every time you recycle your electronics, you are preventing your E-waste from leaching toxic metals into your groundwater. But you’re also preventing it from happing at a mine somewhere else.
                  #### How You Can Help
                  Fortunately, [there’s a proven solution](http://www.ewaste1.com/how-to-properly-recycle-electronics/). The recycling of e-waste serves a lot of useful purposes. For instance, include protecting human and environmental health by keeping those devices out of landfills. Or recovering the parts within the devices that still have value, and providing manufacturers with recycled metals that can be used to make new products.
                  Virtually all electronic waste contains some form of recyclable material. That includes materials like plastic, glass, and metals, which is why they may be considered “junk” or “obsolete” to consumers but still serve an essential purpose. It’s ironic, in some ways, that these devices are called “e-waste,” since they’re not waste at all. But in far too many instances, they are thrown away.
                  [With electronic recyclers like GLEC](http://www.ewaste1.com/), we have a solution. The challenge is getting recycling rates, still stubbornly low, to increase.
                  ## E-waste Problems
                  The definition of e-waste is likely to keep expanding. In an era of rapid technological advancement, more and more highly sophisticated electronic goods are being invented and manufactured. Just think of the concept of the “smart home.” It’s easy to recognize how many electronic devices can now do everything from offer security to turning lights on and off, to having fresh coffee ready before we wake up.
                  Unfortunately, a skyrocketing amount of e-waste is being written off by owners as junk. There’s no more significant example of that than computers, laptops, and smartphones.
                  New models arrive even as the current one appears to be working just fine. Despite that, the latest version always provides additional features that make it seem too enticing to resist.

              Global warming is an aspect of [climate change](https://www.wwf.org.au/what-we-do/climate/climate), referring to the long-term rise of the planet's temperatures. It is caused by increased concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, mainly from human activities such as burning fossil fuels, and farming.
              CAUSES OF GLOBAL WARMING----
              ## 1. Burning fossil fuels
              When we burn fossil fuels like coal, and gas to create electricity or power our cars, we release CO2 pollution into the atmosphere. Australians are big producers of CO2 pollution compared to the rest of the world. Our level of CO2 pollution per person is nearly double the average of other developed nations and more than four times the world average. Electricity generation is the main cause of carbon pollution in Australia as 73% of our electricity comes from burning coal and 13% from burning gas. The remaining 14% comes from renewable energy sources such as hydro, solar and wind, which do not emit carbon.
              ## 2. Deforestation & Tree-Clearing
              Plants and trees play an important role in regulating the climate because they absorb carbon dioxide from the air and release oxygen back into it. Forests and bushland act as carbon sinks and are a valuable means of keeping global warming to 1.5°C.  But humans clear vast areas of vegetation around the world for [farming](https://www.wwf.org.au/what-we-do/food), urban and infrastructure development or to sell tree products such as timber and [palm oil](https://www.wwf.org.au/what-we-do/food/palm-oil/palm-oil). When vegetation is removed or burnt, the stored carbon is released back into the atmosphere as CO2 contributing to global warming.
              **Up to one-fifth of global greenhouse gas pollution comes from deforestation and forest degradation.**
              ## 3. Agriculture & Farming
              Animals, [livestock like sheep and cattle](https://www.wwf.org.au/what-we-do/food/beef/beef), produce methane, a greenhouse gas. When livestock grazed at a large scale, as in Australia, the amount of methane produced is a big contributor to global warming. Some that farmers use also release nitrous oxide, which is another greenhouse gas.

                  Despite its long history of learning and knowledge, the Indian education system has faced numerous challenges, including unequal access to education, outdated curricula, and inadequate funding. Despite these challenges, however, the education system in India has made great strides in recent years, and the country is now home to a large number of well-respected universities and colleges.
                  One of the main challenges facing the education system in India is unequal access to education. Despite the country’s rapid economic growth and increasing prosperity, many rural and underprivileged communities still lack access to quality education. This inequality is reflected in the low literacy rates in these areas, as well as in the high dropout rates for students from these communities.
                  In addition to these challenges, the education system in India also faces a lack of funding. Despite the government’s commitment to education, many schools and colleges still lack the resources they need to provide quality education to their students. This includes funding for basic facilities, such as classrooms and libraries, as well as funding for the development of new curricula and the training of teachers.
                  In conclusion, the education system in India faces many challenges, including unequal access to education, outdated curricula, and inadequate funding. Despite these challenges, however, the country is home to a growing number of well-respected universities and colleges, and the government has made significant progress in addressing the challenges facing the education system. With continued investment in education, India has the potential to become a leading center of learning and knowledge and to provide quality education to all of its citizens.
